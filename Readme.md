**Haikunators**
================

A Rust-based implementation of the Heroku-like memorable random name generator, [Haikunator](https://github.com/usmanbashir/haikunator).

**What is Haikunator?**

Haikunator generates unique and memorable names for your projects, services, or anything else that needs a distinctive identifier. Inspired by Heroku's naming convention, Haikunator creates names that are not only easy to remember but also easy to pronounce.

**Why Haikunators?**

I built Haikunators to learn a little bit of Rust and attempt to implement a Clean Architecture using [Cargo Workspaces](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-03-cargo-workspaces.html).

**Features**

* Generates random, yet meaningful names for projects or services

**Why choose Haikunators over other implementations?**

This Rust-based implementation is designed with Clean Architecture principles in mind. This means that the codebase is modular, maintainable, and easy to understand.

**Getting started**

To use Haikunators, simply clone the repository and run the binary. For example:
```bash
cargo run
```
This will generate a random name using the orginal Haikunator's list of adjectives and nouns.

**License**

Haikunators is released under the MIT License. See `LICENSE` for details.

**Acknowledgments**

I acknowledge [rust-haikunator](https://github.com/nishanths/rust-haikunator), another project that has implemented Haikunator in Rust in a much better way and with much more options. While this implementation may not be as comprehensive, I believe that my it is an educational approach to Clean Architecture in Rust using Cargo Workspaces.
